*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: dev/notes/README-suggest-dart-fix.md
+Proposal: suggest running 'dart fix --apply' from flutter analyze
+
+This directory contains:
+- flutter_analyze_dart_fix_helper.dart : dev helper to demonstrate behavior
+- 0001-suggest-dart-fix-in-analyze.patch : a suggested unified diff to modify packages/flutter_tools
+
+The patch is a proposal and may need to be adapted by maintainers to fit coding guidelines and tests.
+
+Rationale:
+ - Improve UX: when lutter analyze finds issues that dart fix can resolve, suggest dart fix --apply.
+ - Respect machine output and --watch modes.
